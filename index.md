# VHP4Safety Gene Mapping Project

Welcome to the project resource site for comparing gene mapping approaches for pathway-based toxicity analysis using VHP4Safety tools.

## Project Overview

This research project explores two complementary approaches for analyzing toxicological pathways:

1. **GO-based mapping** - Using Gene Ontology terms to categorize gene functions
2. **Pathway-based mapping** - Using WikiPathways to understand biological pathway context

By comparing these approaches in the context of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), we aim to understand their strengths and limitations for toxicity prediction.

## Key Concepts

### Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs)

AOPs provide a framework linking molecular-level events to adverse health outcomes:

- **Molecular Initiating Event (MIE)** - The initial chemical-biological interaction
- **Key Events (KE)** - Measurable biological changes along the pathway
- **Adverse Outcome (AO)** - The health effect of regulatory concern

### VHP4Safety Tools

The Virtual Human Platform for Safety Assessment provides tools for:
- Building molecular AOPs from transcriptomic data
- Analyzing pathway enrichment
- Integrating multiple data sources

## Interactive Exercise

**New to AOPs?** Try our interactive exercise:

This drag-and-drop game helps you understand how AOPs are constructed by arranging molecular events in the correct biological sequence.
